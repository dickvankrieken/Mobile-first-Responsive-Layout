# TechDegree-Unit-2
 
For this project the course provided me with a set of mock-up image files of a basic layout with different viewports that I had to turn into a fully functioning webpage using HTML and CSS. Images were also included. The page needed to build using the mobile-first approach and at two breakpoints (one at 768px width for tablets and one at 1024px width for desktop viewports) mediaqueries were applied in the CSS code so that the pagestructure changes slightly to better fit the size of the screen. 

I am trying to get an "exceeds" rating and therefore I have added and modified the following: 

- Gave the page elements new colors using a green-based color palette. 
- Changed the color of the header text elements.
- Added styling for the hover state on the navigation bar.

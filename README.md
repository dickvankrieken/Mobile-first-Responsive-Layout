# Mobile-first Responsive Layout 
A fully functioning webpage using HTML and CSS. The page was build using the mobile-first approach, using two breakpoints (one at 768px width for tablets and one at 1024px width for desktop viewports). Mediaqueries were applied in the CSS code so that the pagestructure changes slightly to better fit the size of the screen.
